To use this properly on your local machine, first follow the first two
instructions at the top  of the page [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java).

To make a robot project, go to `File -> New -> Other`, select the `WPILib Robot Java Development` folder,
and select `Robot Java Project`. Once you hit next, enter a project name, select `Iterative Robot`, and

you're off to the races.
